# Navbar Design with React, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Daizy UI, and React Router DOM

## Description

This project is an assignment I completed to design a responsive navbar using various technologies, including React, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Daizy UI, and React Router DOM. The navbar design features an open sidebar for desktop devices and a menu with icons for mobile devices. The main menu items include links to the home, about, and blog sections.

- **Daizy UI**: Integrated for enhancing user interface components.
- **React Router DOM**: Managed routing and navigation within the application.

## Features
